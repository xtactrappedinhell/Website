    <q>Personally, I would care for immortality in the least
        There is nothing better than oblivion, since in oblivion
        there is no wish unfufilled.
        We had it before we were born yet we did not complain.
        Shall we whine because we know it will return?
        It is Elysium enough for me, at least.
